# MyList

### After [Animixplay.to](https://animixplay.to) got shut down i have to save my watchlist of my anime somewhere so i created an app which fetches the data from the json api which contains my anime whatchlist form animixplay.to and displays it. though it is a very simple app i'm going to make it more cool in future because im currently learing react native.
